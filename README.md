##User Story
Sometimes in the morning the best part of waking up is not folder's in your cup, its understanding the weather and how to dress for the upcoming day. Once Covid ends and we are able to enjoy something other the comforts of our own homes we will need to see what mother nature holds in store for us, shes a fickle lady, so whether it be rain boot, parkas or shorts be ready with this app. All you need is to type in a city name.
